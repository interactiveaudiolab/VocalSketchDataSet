## Overview
This document describes the dataset for the paper:

Cartwright, M., Pardo, B. VocalSketch: Vocally Imitating Audio Concepts. In *Proceedings of ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems* (2015). http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2702123.2702387

## Abstract
A natural way of communicating an audio concept is to imitate it with one's voice. This creates an approximation of the imagined sound (e.g. a particular owl's hoot), much like how a visual sketch approximates a visual concept (e.g a drawing of the owl). If a machine could understand vocal imitations, users could communicate with software in this natural way, enabling new interactions (e.g. programming a music synthesizer by imitating the desired sound with one's voice). This data set contains thousands of crowd-sourced vocal imitations of a large set of diverse sounds, along with data on the crowd's ability to correctly label these vocal imitations. This data set will help the research community understand which audio concepts can be effectively communicated with this approach. We have released this data so the community can study the related issues and build systems that leverage vocal imitation as an interaction modality.

## Description of directories
* **vocal\_imitations/included** - This directory contains all of the vocal imitation recordings that met our inclusion criteria and were included in our analysis
* **vocal\_imitations/excluded** - This directory contains all of the vocal imitation recordings that did not meet our inclusion criteria and were not included in our analysis
* **vocal\_imitations\_set2/included** - The second set of included imitations
* **vocal\_imitations\_set2/excluded** - The second set of excluded imitations
* **sound\_recordings** - This directory contains the audio files for the referent 'sound recording' instantiations of audio concepts. These are the sounds that contributors of vocal imitations listened to, prior to making their imitations. Here, we provide only those referent sounds we have permission to redistribute, which is all but the 'everyday' sounds.
